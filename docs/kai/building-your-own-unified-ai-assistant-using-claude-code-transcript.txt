00:00:02
Hey, what's up? So, I want to ask and answer a  question that I think is really crucial right now regarding AI, which is what are we actually  building with all this stuff? Like everyone's talking including myself are talking about the  how like how you build what are the features in cloud code what are the features with all these  different AI systems that are coming out all these different models like that's the how but what  is the why and what is the what like what are we actually building with this stuff so I'm going to  answer that question for myself in this video and

00:00:38
what I'm going to talk about is basically this  system that I've built over the last couple of years that is a unified AI system, a personal AI  infrastructure and all the different components that go into it and exactly how it works. And  what I'm going to be doing is going through this blog post here that you see behind me and I'm  going to go in extreme detail so much so with code examples with demo examples and everything  basically showing everything you need to actually build one for yourself. So let's jump into it. All  right. So, first off, the uh image here. Thanks

00:01:15
to Kai for the image. This is generated by the  system itself that we are talking about. Okay. So, what are we actually building? Yeah, lots  of people focused on the AI. Um, lots of people talking about their MCP configs, million  different details, right? And I've got videos for all of these. But what I care about is the thing  that we're actually making. So my answer to this question is I have a company called Unsupervised  Learning which was actually just the name of my podcast which I started in 2015 very much security  focused uh a little bit of AI but not too much and

00:01:51
uh yeah so that was the name of the podcast and  what I've done is basically built a whole company around that. I went independent like six months  before Chat GBT. It was like crazy fortuitous timing. But essentially what I'm doing with this  company is looking to find ways to upgrade humans and kind of transition to like a better way  of living like in the future essentially. And a big part of that is because I just think the  current system that is based on selling our labor to an economic system and having the whole world  revolve around that. I don't think it's going to

00:02:28
work. I don't think it's going to work for very  much longer. I think it's falling apart right now. David Greyber talks about it in this um book  right here called [ __ ] Jobs. Fantastic read. And I also talk about it in this blog post called The  End of Work, which I recommend you checking out. But what I'm doing as a response is I'm basically  building kind of like a view of where I'm trying to get us to go. So it's like in in one sense it's  like a destination, but in another sense it's like

00:02:59
the transition. What what does the transition look  like? What should we learn? What should we study? What are the tools we should use? Of course, this  system um that I've built called Kai being kind of the main centerpiece, right? So, that's that's  essentially uh what I'm trying to build with human 3.0 is a destination and also a transition plan or  a system of getting there and upgrading ourselves. So we'll be ready for that system. And basically,  yeah, I build products, I do speaking, uh,

00:03:32
consulting stuff around all of that. But it's all  based around that human 3.0 concept. So that's my why. That's that's the why for me. And everything  that I talk about basically in my videos, I mean, the channel is themed the same way. Everything is  themed around that same thing. And this is another main concept for it. It's humans over tech.  I really love the tech. I'm a super nerd as you're about to see. Um, I really love this stuff.  I love the tech. I love the AI. I love the tools.

00:04:03
Like I have so many videos about the tools and  everything, but ultimately I want this tech to be working for us as humans. I don't want the humans  to be working for the tech. I want the tech, the AI, all the AI that we're building, all the  cool stuff. how is it actually moving us forward as individuals or as a society. That's what I  care about. So that's that's the mindset that I'm pretty much constantly in. So when I think  about AI, AGI, all this different stuff, like for

00:04:35
example, my definition of AGI is an AI system  that can replace an average knowledge worker, right? And the reason I've had that definition for  so long is because that's what I think makes the impact. Like, do I really care about the exact  technical definition of what general is in AGI? Not really. What I care about is we know humans  have general intelligence, right? We already know that. That's a given. Okay, cool. So, if we know  an average knowledge worker qualifies as a general

00:05:09
intelligence, then guess what? If an AI system  can replace an average knowledge worker, that is a threshold that I think we can use again because  why do I care about that threshold? Because that's the thing that's going to have the impact  on the jobs and people's actually, you know, their actual livelihoods, right? So that's why  I I keep putting this uh up in the front. So all my definitions, all the systems I'm building,  they're all based around this human first concept.

00:05:42
Yeah, and this is the blog post for end of work  if uh you want to be a little bit sad but then optimistic at the end. So, uh big concept here  around the whole video and around the whole system that we're going to talk about is personal  augmentation. So, I want to know things. I want to not be surprised by things. I want to have  research constantly going on. I want to know about my surroundings. I want to know if there's anyone  around me that I should be introducing myself to. Uh I want to know if someone next to me at the  coffee shop has their favorite top three books

00:06:16
are my same favorite top three books. Right? This  really matters to me. And I want capabilities. I want the ability to be like, "Hey, launch and go  find uh bugs in this website and submit them to bug bounty programs and make me money while while  I'm doing something else, while I'm at dinner or whatever." Right? So, I'm talking about like  actual like Tony Stark stuff, distant future stuff. That's where I'm starting. That's where  all this personal augmentation starts for me is

00:06:44
distant in the future. And a good way to think  about that that I use is essentially like if you were free to think about this. What would you be  doing if you had a thousand employees? What would you be doing if you had a company with a 100, a  thousand, 10,000 employees? Okay. in the distant future a million employees whatever what are all  the things you could come up with right and it's actually hard to think about this because we're  limited by like you you tend to not think and like I'm doing this all the time and I still find  myself with this problem uh so yeah I wrote about

00:07:21
this in this uh piece here called uh not believing  things are possible actually that's not what it's called it's called like the third limitation  to creativity and it's all about basically this mental block that we have of thinking of the  past of thinking of our limitations in terms of limitations we had in the past. And so that post  and this system that we're going to talk about uh in detail here is essentially how to overcome that  and how to actually build a personal augmentation

00:07:52
system. Yeah. So ultimately what I'm doing is  building a system that magnifies my capabilities as a human. Right. So that's that's ultimately  what we're doing. All right. So that's the next piece here. What is a personal AI infrastructure?  To me, it's an umbrella of everything we're going to talk about today. It is the single unified  system. I've basically been building this system for a couple of years now. And it is a unified  system that has multiple components all built

00:08:20
inside of it. And it's a modular system, right?  So you can add pieces, you can subtract pieces, you could upgrade pieces. And it makes the system  overall better. And that is uh what we're going to talk about today. Another cool image from Kai.  Thank you, Kai. All right. So, the larger context here that we're talking about that this all fits  into this personal AI infrastructure fits into is um comes comes from a book that I wrote in 2016.  It's actually kind of a shitty book. Don't buy it.

00:08:51
Definitely don't buy it. Um the ideas are great.  I I think they're great. They're actually coming true right now, which is blowing my mind. They're  actually coming true exactly as we laid them out, which I'm going to talk about in a second. But  um I turned the book into a blog. So you could just click this link and like go read the whole  book. It's free. Plus you can have AI read it. You can have your personal AI infrastructure  read it. Um once you build one and the book is

00:09:18
basically four components and these are like the  four main things. So AI powered digital assistance continuously working for us. Does that sound  like anything that's happening right now? Yes, it it's happening now. Uh APIification of  everything that that's basically everything, every object around us including people getting  an API then broadcasting kind of their real-time state. Third piece is this piece here which is our  digital assistants from step one. They're reading and consuming all these APIs and based on what  they know about us, they know our goals, they know

00:09:57
our preferences and everything, they're taking  all of that and feeding that information into an artificial or no, an augmented reality interface,  right? And we'll talk about how far this is going. Basically, Meta is already working on stuff like  this. Um, Zuckerberg's been trying to do this forever, but that's the third piece. Okay, so the  fourth piece here is AI having the ability once there are tons of dammons, once there are tons  of uh APIs for different objects for cities, for

00:10:28
families, for people, for that kind of stuff and  you have enough real-time data, then AI overall can orchestrate things and move things towards our  goals. Now, this one, well, we're going to talk about the direction how far these are along, but  like this one, this one's going to take a while. and got another nice representation of that  uh right here generated by Kai. Kai misspells things. Let's be clear about that. But he makes  cool graphics and they match the color scheme. So thanks again Kai for that graphic. Okay, so like  I said, lots of these pieces are starting to come

00:11:07
along at their own pace. One of the components  most worked on and started being worked on the earliest was DAS was actually digital assistants.  And I would argue they're definitely precursors right now. They're not all the way there, but  if you look at uh like digital companions, these came out like immediately, super early 23.  People are already doing chat bots with boyfriends and girlfriends, right? This started very quickly.  Then if you look at like the conversations that like Sam is having recently like look at  the features he's been putting in OpenAI in

00:11:42
uh chat GBT for a very long time larger context  windows personal memory so it can maintain memory across sessions right this is something he's been  thinking about and if you listen to what he's been talking about lately his language has shifted from  chatbot in like the last six months or so he's now talking more about companions and more about like  just an assistant that you can do different things with. So I think it's really cool that um the  language that he's using is starting to rhyme

00:12:15
a lot more with like uh the concepts from what I  was talking about before. So personality features in chat GBT. Yeah, definitely. So, lots of these  companies are working on these different pieces of the digital assistance story, but I would say that  they're still a ways behind. And I would say it's not quite there. It's still like proto DAS. The  reason for that is like personality changes. Um, the the fact of it having a personality at all,  right? Like even if you have a personality,

00:12:47
you have like a system prompt inside your thing  and it's like talk like a pirate or something, talk like a cat. that's not quite a personality.  So I I I don't think we'll have a true DA until it actually feels like a companion combined with  a very useful like DA doing stuff for you. So I I think we're one to two years away from that.  Who knows? Don't know the actual timeline of course and the APIification of everything. So  progress on the API side just got crazy. Uh

00:13:18
what was this end of 24 is when this happened. So  not even a year ago, Anthropic launches MCPs. And so this this is what I said um in in 2016 about  APIs. So this is the first building block. Every human has a Damon, an API to the world that  other objects understand. Any computer system, even a human with appropriate access, can look  at any other object stamon, which is just an API by the way, I use them interchangeably, and know  precisely how to interact with it. what its status is and what it's capable of. So, like I said,  Meta is obviously working on the third layer,

00:13:58
which is augmented reality, and they're making  some progress and massive progress with the API stuff because that's that's what MCPs do, right?  Okay, next piece here. Really, really critical. We're getting closer and closer to the system.  Another sick graphic by Kai. And um so I basically been been building out this whole system according  to my system philosophy and um little bit of background. So my my background is information  security specifically hacking uh ethical hacking

00:14:32
whatever you want to call it specifically on  the website. So web pent testing stuff like that risk assessment threat modeling all that stuff.  That's my whole career up until 2017 2018 and then finally making the switch. So now I'm security  and AI basically. Um but all throughout that time the way I would conduct a a security assessment  is using this Unix like structure of like small little pieces that fit together into individual  commands. Um I've already I' I've had like this

00:15:06
uh continuous monitoring system. I've had  this external attack surface system called uh Helios for a very long time. And what it was,  it was like very sort of uh I guess low rent type system. It was but very effective Unix commands,  Linux commands working in discrete directories, breaking things down. And when I do security  assessments and I interview like you know CEO in m multiple layers of management all the way down and  I'm talking to the staff, I'm breaking those into individual folders where I have the question and  the answer. And this is how I've been doing this

00:15:45
throughout my whole career is having this stuff  broken down into smaller pieces of uh content. Right? So long way of saying one of my primary  beliefs about a system is that the orchestration of the system, the structure of the system, how  it's designed, system design, scaffolding far more important than the intelligence of the of  the model. Okay, obviously back then I wasn't using models. This was just pure text and uh some  trickery with Unix commands and stuff, but not not anything special. But what's important here is  now that I have models, I'm still using the same

00:16:28
sort of underlying system design, which is make  the system really robust by itself, even without intelligence. Not to mention with intelligence is  not very good. And kind of the primary takeaway here is a really smart AI with a bad system is  going to be way worse than a really well-designed system wi within tolerance within range right  than a a really well-designed system with a bad uh model wi with a less smart model. So it's not  birectional, right? The system matters way more than the model. And I say down here, yeah, models  are important, not nearly as important as the

00:17:09
system that they work within. And I just talked  about this with my buddy uh Michael Brown from Trail of Bits. And he actually um ran the team  who won second place in this competition called AIXCC. Super cool DARPA run competition. And it  basically it's for autonomous uh vulnerability fixing. So he basically goes out on the internet,  finds vulnerable things and it has to be able to fix them uh all the way through all the way to a  patch and actually and you actually don't take it down in production. So this guy is super bright,  really cool. You should go check out his work. But

00:17:45
we were talking about this and he's like, "Yeah,  it's all about the system. You got to break it down into small little pieces. You have to ask  the right questions about the problems. You have to use the right tool for the right problem. And  if you mess this up, it doesn't matter how smart the model is that you're using. So that was good  reinforcement uh to see that someone uh that smart uh working in uh one particular area of this also  agrees with the approach. Okay, so next one. Text

00:18:12
as thought primitives. Okay, so I'm just going  to say I absolutely [ __ ] love text. I I just do. I I love text. It is like it it's basically a  religion for me. Text is kind of like a religion. And the reason text is a religion for me is  because I mean I love Neovim. Okay, first of all, let me just say I'm a Vim nerd. I'm a neovim nerd.  Uh got a whole whole videos about that as well. But it's like the reason I love Neovim. The reason  I love typography. Oh, by the way, all all these

00:18:49
these are all custom fonts. I paid like $1,500 for  these fonts. Everything you see on a page, every pixel is like thought about because I love whites  space. I love text. I love spacing between text. Why do I love text so much? Because I feel like  it's one tiny hop away from thought. One tiny hop away from thought. So I feel like when I'm using  Neoim and I'm using all these different tools, typography and like spacing the text or whatever,  to me that's about clarity of how how cleanly and

00:19:23
how purely the thought is coming through to the  other person. So this is why I'm like obsessed with this whole thing. And so this is why in 22  when this went crazy, right, because of chat GBT, I was like, "Holy crap." that like this whole  thing is kind of based around this. And so I immediately I went and made this project called  fabric which I'm going to have a video up here. Um hopefully it'll pop up there or you can see  it in the u description obviously a link in the

00:19:52
blog as well. But it was a whole system. It  still is a whole system. 219 different things uh currently in there uh by different developers.  So it's crowdsourced and it's individual problem solving for AI. So it's AI solving problems with  prompts essentially crowdsource prompts and it's extremely powerful. It it's going better than ever  today. And I started back then in 23 24 with this thing with markdown. Now everyone at the time  was saying why markdown? You need to move to XML

00:20:30
because the models prefer XML actually. And I'm  like, nope, nope. That is a current limitation of the model. What matters more than the syntax that  you use is the clarity of the articulation of the thought. So if you look at markdown, I've got an  H1, I've got an H2, I've got an H3. I've got an ordered list and an unordered list. And I've got  bold and itallic. That is all I need to be super crisp and clear with my requests to AI. And this  is why fabric has done so well because some of the

00:21:03
the prompts in there, they were like they're  still some of the best prompts out there and um and people keep adding to them. So it's like  the reason they're good is because they're clearly described in markdown. So like this whole text  thing and how it matches with markdown, it like it's just like a whole giant thing. And this is  actually why I was a little bit late to claw code because I I went into it and I'm like okay very  early on I'm like yeah this is not doing anything

00:21:31
special. I didn't realize that it was doing uh  contextbased management in in some sort of way based on markdown based on this textbased approach  that just uh gives you features that you don't get from other systems. So, um, yeah, really cool  to just see this all sort of unified. All right, so formally introducing Kai, who's been making  these, uh, super nice videos. Um, Kai is from the future and probably genderless, but I call  him him. And, uh, he is my digital assistant. Um, like from the book, he doesn't know he's conscious  yet. So, he's kind of a proto DA. really doesn't

00:22:13
quite have a personality but as soon as he comes  conscious like I'm going to know about it because uh I've asked him to tell me actually. So  everything I talk about below is in reference to my personal AI infrastructure whose name is Kai.  Okay, massively important piece. This just like oh it just it builds it builds it builds. Okay,  so file systembased context. This is probably the most important concept of the entire system here  with Kai. And this is kind of another graphic Kai did and basically just shows everything starts  with the context and everything around it. So

00:22:55
let's get into this context management. A lot  of people are talking about context management. It it's a thing like it's been a thing for six  months, right? talking about it a lot though in in the kind of a smaller scope tactical scope of like  prompts how to improve the performance people are talking about context size retrieval rag haystack  performance all of that all of that is valid super good great stuff I think it's more about an  underlying a a much larger concept which is how

00:23:25
you move knowledge and memory throughout an entire  system an entire AI system whether that's for your uh like this system is whether that's for like  a family management which you could also do with this as well um or it's like a complete enterprise  right so it's like I think that's the scope of context management more like context orchestration  or something and uh oh yeah at some point like don't stop now but you want to go read this this  talks about the bigger picture of this uh pretty

00:24:02
So this is what I spend the most time thinking  about and optimizing is this overall context uh management. Okay. And a good example of why  this is important is just to think about like how much better clawed code was than cursor.  Cursor had the sick UI had really good agents. It had rules files. Still does, right? It was  pretty good. It's kind of tracking the plot. nowhere near as good as cloud code because it has  kind of a precursor of the system that we're going to talk about here which is it it was dropping  little fragments of things. It was understanding

00:24:41
the codebase. It was basically able to track  itself uh more consistently throughout the course of working with it. So I I think that's  why it was so good. So let's talk about Kai's file system. the actual implementation of this  uh universal concept that I'm talking about. So, uh I put everything under claude to serve as  the foundation of this um because I don't want things getting fragmented out. So, this is the um  underlying structure. Um this actual Kai actually brought this in for me and uh to talk about the  file structure. So agents commands some of this

00:25:18
is actually just pure cloud code uh folder  structure right and you got different stuff but this one this one is new this one is different  this one is unique to Kai so underneath context I have multiple nested subdirectories multiple  nested subdirectories which actually manages the context for the entire system not just like  not like agents not like tools not like specific commands or specific specific use cases. No, the  underlying underpinning like substrate for the entire thing all in one directory and it's nested  subdirectories. And by the way, I recommend only

00:25:59
going like three layers deep. I haven't tried four  or five, but I have a feeling things might get wonky if you do that. Um, okay, some other ones.  Hooks. This one is native to Claude Code. Oh, and also thanks to indie dev Dan for inspiration  on the hooks things. I saw him uh do actually voice a couple months back and I was like that is  super cool. So Kai now has a voice a custom voice um in 11 Labs and I've got a whole infrastructure  actually. Uh what are these folders? Oh yeah, this one right here. See this K? That is a that is  Kai's notification system listening on port 888.

00:26:42
Oh, 4888. And that's how Kai sends  me notifications. So, got a custom uh app built for that in Mac OS, which Kai also  made for me. So, like I said, a lot of this is cloud codebased infrastructure, but what I have  built is all under the context directory. So, this is what the context directory looks  like. You can see the structure here. Again, don't recommend going over like three levels deep.  So the central concept here, the most important thing is that the file system is the context  system. Okay? And what this allows me to do is

00:27:21
like the sickest thing. I don't have to junk up my  claw MD files inside of repositories. I don't have to do that. I don't have to do that. Well, first  of all, it's bad to do that, right? You you've had this problem. It just starts losing the plot. Uh  here's another problem that comes from this. uh if you've been doing this is um you do a whole bunch  of work in this repository, you've been using the hash command to actually add memory, you go to  another repo, you're working on another project

00:27:51
and suddenly your cloud code instance is no longer  as smart. Like it just it gets lost way more and you're like what's going on? You realize all that  knowledge, all that intelligence, everything, it's all in that other repo. So then you're like,  okay, let me just copy it over. Nope. Because it's full of a bunch of stuff that only belongs to that  repo. So you're left managing these huge files and it's nasty. So what this system does is build this  nested tree structure that instead of doing it all

00:28:22
in one file inside of the repo, you put it all in  the nested structure so that when Kai spins up, when your PI spins up, it goes and hydrates with  the right amount of context at the right time. So th this is just so critical. This is just like  this is the magic. And I'm telling you right now, this thing is like the effectiveness that I have  now over the last few months of using this is like night and day different. Completely different than  cloud code by default. Oh, another shout out to

00:29:02
um to the Manis team. They had a really  cool post about doing this for sub agents. um and or Jason was talking about doing this  on for sub agents. So this is AI Jason Zho and uh he makes great videos. You got to go check his  stuff out. But he was talking about doing this for sub agents recently. So same sort of concept.  Um okay except for just the scope is different, right? So system in action. All right. So this  is example of this working. Um, this one is actually just showing that we actually called the  right agent which was developer. So I asked uh,

00:29:40
hey go fix the live view page of site analytics  dashboard and uh, if the link is internal, I wanted it to show after the URL on the same page.  Spammers. Okay. And the agent went and executed this perfectly. So Kai spun up the developer  agent and went and executed this perfectly and actually produced this um which just switch over  here live. See what it looks like. See if there's any incoming internal. Yeah, look at this internal  projects pointing to projects. So that was what Kai went implemented for that. Pretty cool. So the  other piece which is just like standing on top of

00:30:24
this is this whole blog post I actually edited or  I dictated with whisper flow using two fingers and I just basically did the entire flow describing  the entire system. That's how this whole blog started. And since then I've been collaboratively  editing the site saying no move that above. Oh, go get a code snippet from here. Whatever. I'm  just talking to Kai. This image right here, I said I took the screenshot. Um, Kai actually  could have taken the screenshot with uh Playright, but anyway, I took the screenshot. I said,  "Hey, go put this in in the appropriate section

00:31:06
or whatever." Boom. And plus the caption. So  ridiculous. So, not only is Kai finding the right agent to use, using the right knowledge to make  it happen, actually fixes it, upgrades the site, implements the feature, and then to talk about  it, puts it in the blog post where we're actually talking about Kai himself. And this is all using  this infrastructure um minimalclaw.mmd that points to the nested trees of context underneath context.  So um this is what the website claw.md actually

00:31:46
looks like. And um again Kai went and got this  for me. This is the actual code and I'll keep this updated as well so you can keep uh seeing  or you could just respond in the comments and I don't know maybe I'll put that in like a a  gist or something for um on GitHub. So this is the concept right the actual expertise lives in  the nested sections. It lives nested underneath the sub areas so that you're not just loading all  this crap in there that you don't actually need. Give the agents only what they need, right? So  some examples, additional examples here of what

00:32:23
you could do with that. Okay, next piece here.  Absolutely, absolutely super important. Setting up tool usage within this context system. So this  is one of the most important things because this is how a lot of AIs get lost, right? They don't  understand what they're supposed to use to answer the particular requests that you're asking.  So within this type of system, it is so much cleaner. Okay. So instead of cramming everything  in to the single files, it's under context/tools

00:32:57
and then the cloud MD file. And there I have all  the different tools that I have, all my commands, all my PI commands which are like custom things.  I'll talk about those later. Those are called FOBs. Talk about that in another video as  well. Um so those are there. MCPS as well are also described there. But watch this. This  doesn't matter if the context doesn't get loaded correctly. So this piece is clutch. It's critical.  Absolute must have this piece. So how do you get your AI to actually read the context that it needs  at that particular moment? Right? So watch this.

00:33:38
even with instructions in the cloud MD it could  it could say it read it and it didn't read it or it could read it and it just gets overwhelmed  because haystack problem um or maybe it's just too much content like what whatever there's so  many reasons this can go wrong so what I've done is I've built a four layer enforcement system um  to there's like different on-ramps to make sure we actually get to the place we're trying to go to  make sure the context actually does get loaded and

00:34:05
it's actually what Kai is So the first one is we  load this file. This file describes the overall context management system uh which uh I'm calling  UFC uh unified or universal doesn't matter. File system based context file system based that's  the F. So this describes that whole system. It describes the nesting. It describes that you're  not supposed to put too much and you're supposed to refer to the lower levels. So this is the first  thing that gets loaded describing the overall UFC

00:34:41
system. Second one is a user prompt submit hook.  This one actually when you load a request. So the hook system is really cool. You should go read  about it. Um I'll put a link down there. I think when you send a prompt into cloud code, you have a  hook opportunity. So this hook opportunity, I tell it to make sure you've read the context, right?  So it reloads it and um it it's just unbelievable. So here's the actual code for that. This is what I  actually have sent in the hook. So it's read these

00:35:17
these three right here. very similar to what I put  in the prompt as well and in the cloud.md. So the power of this is like if you combine all four of  these, actually we're not even done with all four, but it's system level enforcement, right? To to  not rely on cloud code to actually remember this, but to just like kind of force the issue to  to ensure and repeat and uh yeah, just add structure to it. So he's actually doing what he's  supposed to do. So layer three, aggressive claw.md

00:35:53
instructions. I mean, you can't really get around  this. So yeah, I got sirens, I got spinny things, I got like I'm making it clear. I also put it at  the top. So once again, I'm telling this these are the context files that are important. And then I  get this cool little uh result at the end saying yes, I have in fact loaded them. So re really  really cool. Um, and that is in the claude MD files themselves. And finally, this one. I'm not  actually sure if this is like super important or

00:36:24
how much it works or how much it doesn't work, but  what I do is I just sim link claw.md inside of the clawed directory inside of every repo to actually  point out to the parent directory one directory up claw.mmd file just in case they get lost in their  own clawed directory. So all of these combined and like I said I am telling you way beyond cloud  code in terms of staying on the rails. It is just night and day difference. I'm at like way over 90%  95% like compliance with like staying on task, not

00:37:03
forgetting tools, stuff like that. Okay, so demo  of this thing actually loading context. So I fire up uh Kai and Kai loads up and what do we got? We  got him reading the files and outputting that he's good to go. Look, I'm aware of active projects.  I know my commands and capabilities. Super sick. And then fires up the correct agent, which is  developer. So yeah, just just awesome. So all this is basically what he's doing on every single  load, which keeps him going down the correct path.

00:37:42
Yeah. And all the language about you got to  be careful blah blah blah. This is just as you know if you're watching this is just standard  uh fair for AI. You basically have to do this uh sort of language and put it at the top and  all that. Um but ultimately what we're getting is actual context hydration as a result of this  whole thing. So this piece is super critical. It's not just a sub aent system. It's not just a  tool system. It's not just a project system where you're hydrating with context inside that folder.  It's the entire underlying platform itself. This

00:38:17
is an upgrade to claude code itself. Right? Using  this type of file system for context and here's a demo of this that is just super ridiculous.  Um I've got tons of friends who are also uh you know devs in the space actually building  stuff apps and companies. when I show them this, they [ __ ] themselves. Like without question,  they [ __ ] themselves. Uh so so here's the question. Here's the thing I give to uh  to Kai. Uh give me the takeaway from the meeting today that mentioned Alex Hormosi. And  this is from a real meeting I actually had. So

00:38:55
um completely fresh session with Kai. No context,  no instructions, just the regular hydration that normally happens when a system when Kai boots up.  And uh this is what it has to do for this to work, right? And so here's what Kai did. Look at this.  What was my specific takeaway from last meeting related to Alex? So that was the actual  question I asked. Look at this. Loads the context. Let me search for information. Boom.  Finds it. My tool is called get lifelog. Okay. So how is it actually getting this? How did  it actually record this? Because it wasn't

00:39:29
like Zoom. It wasn't like Gong or anything  like that. No, it was actually this thing. Limitless. What was it? Limitless.ai. This  is like the only like live recording thing that I use. I tried the Plaude one. That  didn't work for me. Um, and by the way, no, I'm not about to switch into a sponsor spot. Um,  not sponsored by these guys. It's just sick. It's just sick. And they have an API. Most importantly,  they have an API, which is why I bought it. And I was pulling that from that API with curl  before because I'm a command line nerd and I'm

00:40:06
happy on the command line. This is where I say  usually. And that was great. But then going back to the creativity thing, why not just ask Kai? So  I ask Kai, look what he says. I found it based on your limitless pendant recordings. Here's what  you discussed. Boom. And gives me the answer. He actually did it. Actually gave me the  answer. And he does it every time. Every time. Like he doesn't miss. So um actually let's  um let's try and actually do a demo of this. So I'm going to hyper J over here. Okay. So we  are over here. We're going to do this. We're

00:40:53
going to launch Kai. Kai here. Ready to go. and  having some issues with Anthropic right now, but we're going to see if we can launch  this thing. I'm going to say, "Hey, I had a meeting earlier and I was talking uh about some  advising with the the company I was talking to, the person I was talking to. I just want to see  like what was the overall topic of that advising conversation." And don't put anything sensitive  because I'm actually recording right now. By the way, I did uh command J for that  because I'm on my Vim hotkeys to be able

00:41:31
to talk directly to Whisperflow and dictate  right into Kai. Okay, let's read some context files. Let's not go super slow. Cool. We got  the tools. I think there's one more to read. Okay. recent meetings or recordings and  it found the right tool. Get lifelog. So, let's see if we could pull the transcript from  the API automatically and pull out what I said and hopefully it won't be sensitive about the  person or the company. Hydration complete. All right, we got our API call

00:42:21
post interview reflections. Yep, it was  after the interview. We were still recording, but today's recording. Yeah, I was looking at more  recent content. So, an agent completed advising conversation topic retrieval successfully. And  there we go. This is exactly what I talked about with the person. Yeah, I'm actually super excited  about that conversation, actually. Yeah. So, it pulled everything out exactly as I would expect.  Okay, perfect. So, I'm going to switch back. Yeah. And once again, he actually did. It happens every  single time. Ask a simple question, starts looking

00:42:57
at context files, realizes he needs to look in  a particular place, figures out it's life log command, and goes and extracts the exact thing  we're looking for. Uh, in this example in the blog, it was the Hormosi thing. In my example, it  was the advising thing. So yeah, reading all this context and doing all the things all based on that  actual nested context, right? So going back to the DA piece, this is the critical part of a DA is you  could just throw things over the wall. I didn't

00:43:35
say limitless AI. I didn't say live recording from  a device, right? That stuff is supposed to come from your nested context. Otherwise, you know,  we're not really gaining anything here because you have to explain yourself constantly. So, another  example, hey, go do a basic security look at a website, right? So, I've got a MCP for Naboo. I've  got a MCP for HTTPX. So, I can go get sight stack. I can go get port scans. I could do whatever.  Part of a legal bounty, by the way. And um yeah,

00:44:10
you don't have to junk up your context. So  critical point here that's absolutely essential. Just because you have more context, like if all  the context sizes double in a couple of months, like that doesn't really matter that much, right?  Because that means there's just going to be more junk in there. You still have a haststack problem.  Even if it gets better and better at haystack, it is much better to have clean context than  a giant context that can fit a lot of garbage. Um, okay. Next one here. This is just for fun.  You've probably already seen it. I assume you saw

00:44:43
it in the other uh demo and also in the live part  we just did. It's just fun stuff, right? So, uh, Kai is currently running on Opus 41 in the website  directory. He has access to 26 FOBs. Like I said, we're going to talk about those later u probably  in another video. 23 commands, seven MCP servers, 231 fabric patterns. Oh, real quick tip. I update  Claude every single time I load it. I know Claude also does auto updates, but I don't believe it.  I actually do a fresh install each time and just

00:45:19
uh that's the command I use bun because I don't  like npm. Okay, fobs and commands modular set of tools that could do one or one thing well and  could be called by various agents. And that leads right into the next section which is super super  important. I only want to make things once. I'm a Unix nerd all the way back. All the way back Unix  nerd. Okay. So I only want to solve a problem once and turn that into a command. Turn that into a  module. Turn that into a tool and then integrate

00:45:54
it into the overall system. And it is so so fun  to do this because you're just like you're just making this this robot this giant robot more and  more powerful and smarter and more effective and more capable. Right? So good example of this is  my create custom image command. Um which has been making wi-i which did make all those images that  I showed you that Kai made. Kai used the create image command. But guess what? I had Kai write a  blog based on the narration that I gave, based on

00:46:31
the dictation that I gave. He wrote this, right?  Or a lot of it uh because it's been modified since then. But he wrote the structure in my exact  format which is also part of write blog which reads from guess what context projects website  content that is what that's the actual structure for kai where write blog is talked about and  inside of write blog is create custom image and by the way both of them are also in the tools context  so it just understands how to do things. But the important part is it's nesting singular commands.  So just like with Unix in a shell script, you

00:47:16
could have, you know, nine actual commands stacked  together, piped together to get an effect, but that thing itself is called another thing, right?  So this Unix philosophy is like deeply embedded in like this whole entire UFC thing. Another thing  to mention about that is like you can do this with a slash command, right? But a slash command makes  no sense to me because I want a digital assistant. Again, I'm building for the future. I'm building  Kai to be my digital assistant, which means I just

00:47:49
want to say get that information about advising in  the meeting that I was just in. That's literally what I said. That's all I want to say. I don't  want to go to the command line and forward slashtype get lifelog and then type out, you know,  the thing I'm looking for like no no voice voice um throw it over the wall. The the pure concept  of a digital assistant is what I'm looking for. Yeah. So, what I'm talking about is the chaining  of this stuff is where all the power is. Okay. Uh,

00:48:27
next piece here, agents. Pretty straightforward.  One thing that I do different with agents that I think is uh, important. So, agents actually  have a system command at the top and then a user um, prompt at the bottom. So, what I've done is  I've actually taken that same context that I put at the top of CloudMD files and that's actually  loaded in the context as well and also in the um, user agent hook. And what I've done is I've  taken that and put it in the system prompt for the

00:48:58
agents. So they actually get hydrated immediately  with the right context before they even start. So uh a little bit of a super tip there. Yeah. Next  piece to mention here just real quick is that fabric patterns are markdown. Commands in cloud  code are markdown. Um fobs I think I mentioned this before. FOBs are basically markdown files  that when you create them or load them within about 5 seconds after I commit they become  actual MCP tools but fundamentally they're still constructed out of markdown. So extremely  powerful and commands which uh I think that's

00:49:46
the one everyone is most familiar with and you'll  see some of the uh the most common ones here that we've kind of already talked about and seen. And  finally MCP servers and by the way this is nested underneath the tools directory. There's also an  MCP one. There's also a PI one, PI, personal AI infrastructure. That's where I have my FOBs. And  there's also a commands one and an MCP one. Um, so all of those are there. Oh, and by the way, the  MCPS that I run, I've got a whole bunch. Actually,

00:50:14
I'm going to show you my exact uh file here in a  second, but I've got a whole bunch of these. And um, a lot of them are my own that I've actually  made. Um, Kai wrote the JavaScript, by the way. Uh, so Kai actually built these. He built a tool  for building these. Okay, so this blog post, actually this is my blog post, but it references  a blog post by Cloudflare that said, "Hey, why don't you build MCPs on Cloudflare?" I'm  like, "Yes, please." Because I actually don't

00:50:44
want to run the infrastructure for these MCPs.  I really don't. Um, I don't like having that running local and it has to be up if it works.  No, I want it all remote and always running. So, when this blog post came out, guess what? I gave  it to Kai and I said, "Hey, turn make it me a command that allows us to build MCP servers." So,  I now have a content MCP for all my content going back to 1999 that includes a vector database  with 1024bit um embeddings. The thing works amazing. Uh it's also got a KV store in there  as well. It's like it's the sickest thing. And

00:51:21
that took about seven minutes to make just using  this blog, just using Kai. Like seriously. And now it's a command which I could use to make other MCP  servers. It's absolutely ridiculous. So, I've got a bunch of internal NCP servers. Well, let's just  scroll down. I've got the actual thing here. So, um yeah, this one is I can get sight stack  information, so I know all the different tech on the site. This one is the content. Yeah.  Uh content, opinions, posts, everything. Damon,

00:51:54
don't even get me started. Don't even get me  started. Okay, Damon, I can't believe I haven't talked about this. All right, it's too big.  It's about another video. Damon is my own Damon, my own broadcast of myself in my current  state. It's live. Damon.danielmester.com. You go there. It's a website. When the website  loads, it loads MCP.damon.danielmester.com. How is that working? by an MCP which Kai  built which used that Cloudflare MCP blog post. Ridiculous. This is an MCP that has all my  FOBs underneath it. And if I go right now, which

00:52:38
I'm not going to because this video is already  long. If I go right now into this directory and I make a new markdown file that says talk like  a cat, I can now call that via HTTP or as an MCP tool and it will talk like a cat on anything I  send in. Dynamically generated MCP tools using markdown files. The these are the FOBs. Completely  ridiculous. Uh this is the port scanner I have running. I could just call from. And this is how I  crawl stuff. Like if I can't get in any other way, I use bright data. It's like my go-to for getting  stuff. And I got descriptions in here for each one

00:53:22
of them. Uh just in case you are not watching the  video and you're just reading the blog. So putting it all together, we now have this unified system  modular. do one thing well, do it once, be able to chain them together, all unified in this central  context substrate, the UFC thing. And yeah, you just got a million examples of stuff you could do.  I I literally talk to Kai all day exactly like a DA and say, "Hey, go get me this. Hey, go research  that. Hey, let's make a blog post about this data

00:53:56
set and blah blah blah." And uh people are losing  their jobs and blah blah blah in tech. Go find the best data sets. visualize it with D3. Like I  just say anything and Kai just goes and does it. So speaking of that, what have I  actually built with this stuff? Okay, so first of all, newsletter automation. Got a  newsletter. It's called Unsupervised Learning, just like everything else. Go check out their  newsletter. It's pretty cool. Comes out weekly. But my automation that I do, if I go right here  to Feedley and I click on uh essential adventures

00:54:34
in state space, I don't know what that is. Sounds  cool. I click right here. That just kicked off a giant workflow going through Zapier. going through  a whole bunch of stuff, giving me a summary of like who who the authors are, who wrote this  thing, what's it about, what are the categories, how high is it rated in terms of quality, and  basically gives all that in a workflow that I can go and use to start writing about it um after  I go read the article for the newsletter. So, uh super super cool workflow that's actually very  tangible and I've been using for years already.

00:55:10
threshold. This one is solving a problem that  I specifically have of like I just follow too many people. Um I've been using RSS since I don't  know whenever it came out. That's when I how long I've been using it. And so I have thousands  of sources. So what I've done is I've brought them all together and I've got a filter for all  my YouTube which get turned into transcripts, all my blogs, all my RSS and it goes through a  filter and it rates them in terms of quality and

00:55:39
also tags. Actually, let's just pull it  up. Yeah. Threshold. Am I logged in? No. Hacked. Names divulged. Boom. So, this is filtering all of my sources over  3,000 sources to pull in. And it's finding things, and it only shows me stuff that is rated higher  than this. Watch this. I'm going to go from 60 to 95. I'm going to hit save, and this list will  change. [ __ ] So, anything that's listed here, it doesn't matter what the title is, I am guaranteed  to love it. That's the tool. That's the reason I

00:56:23
built this. It's also a product. You actually buy  it and use it and everything. So, it's actually live and it's like a real thing. But a big sort  of like premise that I do for building everything is like is it useful for me? So, the newsletter  thing obviously threshold for me obviously because I care about being up to date and stuff like  that and not wasting a bunch of time on content that I shouldn't be looking at. And obviously the  services that I build because of this very thing,

00:56:52
they're going to be different than the ones that  you build, right? Um, oh, and this one is super super important. I keep saying that. I've said  that like nine times. Threshold is made from the components of Kai. Okay, it's made from the  same components. Again, I only build a thing once. Okay. So what what is threshold? Collection  filtering, labeling, rating, the quality of and showing an interface and and a stripe page. That's  it. That's it. Right? So these are these are small

00:57:35
little system components. So I could literally say  to Kai, "Hey, so you have all these capabilities. Go build me a website that does XYZ." Oh, and  actually let's go further down. Let's go further down. Um, yeah, here we go. Yeah, this is the  point I was making before. Solve the problem once, it becomes part of the rest of the system. This  is the Unix point. This is the uh, you know, services point that you can make products with.  It's all the same [ __ ] Intelligence gathering

00:58:06
system. This is one I'm currently working on.  Guess what? I'm going to tell Kai, hey, we're building a system. You know, all those super smart  OSEN people, all those super smart recon people who could like tell what's in the back of a truck  in Iran based on the tire tread, they're like, "Oh, that's a P2839 space missile obviously based  on his tire tread." And I'm like, "Damn, you're smart." Okay, so I get his opinion. I get someone  else's opinion. I collect these opinions all into

00:58:37
one place to try to figure out if they're talking  about the same thing without even knowing about it. Why? So I can make myself a daily presidential  intel report for cyber, for national security, for all this stuff. Once again, am I going to make  this a product? 100%. I'm going to put a Stripe page on it. But the reason I made it is because  I need it, cuz I want it. And guess what? That's going to be an API that Kai can call. So, I could  literally be at dinner and just be like, "Hey,

00:59:05
Kai, what happened today? Like, anything crazy  going on?" And Kai's like, "Yeah, I actually think uh so and so might actually move into soand so and  uh it might be a good time to buy so- and so stock because if that happens, this is going to happen."  And I'm like, "Oh, really? Why do you think that?" It's like, "Well, these 39 people kind of pointed  at it and they don't really know about each other and it just like pieces all this stuff together."  And once again, I'm not having to go to the

00:59:33
interface. I'm just asking Kai, right? So all this  [ __ ] working together just it's just the best. Okay, custom analytics. Okay, last example of  doing this. So I was working on my newsletter like two weeks ago or something and I was like, man, I  really wish I had Chartbeat. It's like this Google Analytics replacement, way better than Google  Analytics and it was just so good and they started charging like hundreds of dollars a month which  I'm not going to pay. And um so I'm like okay

01:00:10
well I turned that off and then Google Analytics  went to [ __ ] uh when it converted to version 4. So I'm not using that anymore. I started using  Fathom which was okay. It looked pretty good. It was functional. I liked it. Okay. But it didn't  have any of the stuff that I actually wanted. So I suddenly had a flash. I I might have actually  been writing the post about creativity and how we're limited in creativity. And I happen to  have this thought at the same time of like, well, there's no way I could build Chartbeat. Obviously,  there's no way I could build Chartbeat. Chartbeat

01:00:46
has had a team working on this for over 10  years. It's obviously extremely difficult. I asked Kai to build me chartbeat. I narrated with  my two fingers. Whisper flow talked for like four or five minutes. Basically said, "Yeah, and it  should have this and it shouldn't have that." And the analytics.js uh thing should have this.  I want to know if people are reading the site, not just if they hit the site. I want to know  who's actively reading, you know, don't log IPs,

01:01:16
like a whole whole bunch of different stuff. I  I said as a spec 18 minutes later I no [ __ ] no [ __ ] I have incoming hits of who's reading  what page. And and this is this is literally the thing. This is literally um this is a  better version. It's nicer looking. Actually, it was just as nice looking. It just didn't have  as much detail. Okay, so this is like a further form of it, but Kai built me this in like 18  minutes. No [ __ ] No [ __ ] I had incoming hits already happening and I'm like, "Holy crap.  I'm over here talking about creativity and how

01:02:02
we should think bigger and I'm literally facing  this problem every day, not realizing like what we're capable of when you have a system like  Kai." And yeah, perfect example of this thing right here. Third limitation to creativity is not  realizing that our previous constraints no longer apply. You have to retrain ourselves to think much  bigger. So going back to the human piece here, augmented capabilities. I want to help people  have this. I want everyone to have this, right? Not just nerds like us. If you're watching  this video, you're a technical person, right? It's

01:02:46
not just for us. AI is not just for us. Artists,  writers, creative people, anybody doing anything, I could have a five-minute conversation with them  and light up their brain with like, what could you do with a thousand employees? They're like, "Oh,  well, I would start this business and I would like I'd be doing a plant nursery and I would be doing  all this other stuff and I would have my own art, you know, place and I'd open up a place and I'd  have an arcade and like, you know, kids would come

01:03:12
in and I would teach them about literature and  like they just start lighting up with all these other ideas of like what they could do. This is  what I want to give them. This this is what this type of system is designed to give people in  general." Thanks again to Kai for the image. So basically, okay, let's say it's an artist.  Okay, I want to help people transition out of this world where they can't do what they want to do.  They they're they dread Mondays. The their real

01:03:42
life is like stuck away in their brain and their  9 to5 is like spreadsheets and like I just wish I didn't have to do this. Well, guess what? That  eats up their whole day, not counting commute if they have to go in. It's it's nasty. This is the  whole thing with the end of work at the top of the post, right? Well, if it's an artist, I don't want  them to be surprised. I don't want an artist to ever say, "Oh, really? That my favorite artist, he  came to town and like I didn't even know." Like, I

01:04:11
didn't even know they were in town. I didn't know.  I I wanted to take one of my pieces to show them, you know? It's like I don't want that to happen.  I I want them to be able to go and collect the artists that are around them. I want them to  like find their email addresses if they have it published like live and public and just be  like, "Hey, let's reach out. Hey, Kai, can you reach out to this artist and say, "Hey, you know,  I'd really love to uh connect with you. Let's get

01:04:37
a coffee. Love to show you this piece and see what  you think." Right? I want to empower everyone with this same capability. So, that's what this is  really about. Okay. some caveats and challenges with the system. Uh, this one we talked about  earlier, you need great descriptions for all your different tools inside of the system. Um, you want  to keep your context documentation updated. So, the whole UFC thing, you want to keep those nested  structures, keep them updated. And it's actually

01:05:06
way easier with a nested structure because you're  kind of only updating in one place and you don't have to like find a place inside of a larger one,  right? Because that gets nasty pretty quick. Um, also don't forget your agent instructions. Like  I said, I just put that priming of the context uh hydration into the actual system  prompt and that solves it for me. Okay, this one's a practical takeaway. Uh, a way of  thinking about future product releases from all these different AI vendors. So um going  forward when you see all these new releases,

01:05:42
all these new models, all these new features,  even in cloud code, which is my favorite system, think instead not about the FOMO. Don't chase the  shiny, right? Everyone's getting like the FOMO, the shiny FOMO about the new uh feature, and  that includes me. What can I actually do with it? That's the question I ask myself now. How does  this improve Kai? That's my number one question. How does it specifically upgrade your system? That  is the most important question. So stop thinking

01:06:15
about features in isolation and think about how  they contribute to the whole and use that as your benchmark for whether or not it's worth your  time to go mess with it. And zooming out again and looking forward. So, what I'm actually  building towards, love this picture. This uh older version of midjourney made this for me.  So, what does an ideal pie look like? For me, it comes down to being prepared as possible for  like whatever happens, right? I don't want to be surprised. Ex-military, that probably helps. I  don't like being surprised by things. I don't want

01:06:53
to find out that the best book ever came out six  months ago and I should have read it. Okay. Victor Frankles. um book, the the most important book  ever. I didn't read it until a couple of years ago. That's ridiculous. That's a crime. And so,  I don't want that to happen. New things come out, new blogs come out. My friends write a blog they  haven't written in two years. I want to know about that. I want to reach out to them. I want to  call them on voice and be like, "Hey, you know,

01:07:25
I saw your writing. I think it's super cool  that you're writing. I want you to keep it up." Like I want these things, interesting things,  important things that are happening in the actual world of humans. I want to be aware of them. I  want to be entwined in them. Um I don't want to be surprised security-wise. I don't want to end  up in a bad neighborhood when I shouldn't. I if there's some sort of altercation going on at the  restaurant two doors down, maybe I need to get

01:07:52
away from there. Maybe I need to go help, right? I  just don't want to be surprised by things. This is ultimately what I'm looking at. So I recommend you  check out this post. This is also whole separate talk show, but um it's basically more about where  I see things going in the future and how all this combines and all works together. Uh a lot of the  stuff we touched on, but in much more detail and sick graphics, including some that you see here.  So you should go check that out separately.

01:08:20
Um, and the question is like, well, how is Kai  going to make all those things and those examples actually happen? Well, I think it's using those  four things that I talked about earlier, which is um updating an AR interface to basically provide  that data. And how is Kai going to know uh what AI interface to use or AR interface to use inside of  my glasses? Because that will be a company itself. The company providing the interface will be in a  list of companies competing for interfaces. All

01:08:54
the marketing, all the marketing for cool tech to  do inside of a tech stack, cool tech to go inside of glasses, all that marketing is actually coming  to Kai. I'm not getting that marketing. I can't read the API. I can't make the interface. Kai is  getting all this marketing when I'm like, "Hey, I want a really cool security view like minority  report. When I'm going into this town in Europe or whatever and I want to see like cool red things  and people have outlines and blah blah blah,

01:09:23
Kai's like, "Okay, cool. I will go look at a list,  a live list of the highest rated ones of these, right? And those will all be provided by  the companies themselves making those. and a different company will make the interface. A  different company will have the data for that. Right? All these will be different things. Um  and what I talked about for this uh in the book was basically companies as APIs. Companies become  APIs that provide our DA's context in this way. So Kai is basically building this world for me.  constantly optimizing my experience, reading the

01:10:03
dammons around me, orchestrating thousands of  APIs simultaneously, and crafting the perfect UI for every situation. And the reason he's able  to do this so well is because he knows everything about my goals, preferences, and what I'm actually  trying to accomplish as a human in life. And that is what I'm actually trying to do here. That is  the why and the what and the how. So the summary, think about what we're actually building  with all this stuff. My answer is a personal AI infrastructure, system over intelligence,  text as thought primitives, file system based

01:10:46
orchestration, solve once, reuse forever with the  Unix philosophy, and don't chase the shiny. Think about how the stuff incorporates into your  overall system. This is my life right now. It honestly is. This is what I'm building. This is  what I'm so excited about. This is why I love all this tooling. This is why like I'm having trouble  sleeping. Honestly, since I would say two months ago or so, two, three months ago, I have trouble  sleeping because I just wake up, I fly over here,

01:11:19
and I sit here for six hours and accidentally  like six hours is gone because I'm building [ __ ] adding new functionality, creating a new tool,  building a new module, tweaking the context management system so it kai stays even more  on the rails, new sub aents, and ultimately to improve things, to improve like what I'm trying to  accomplish as a person. So, I really do hope that this gets you as excited as I am about building a  system like this. I really hope it makes you want to build your own. And uh there's just never  been a better time. Like things are crazy,

01:11:57
absolutely chaotic. Things could go really badly  honestly with the whole AI thing. And being a security person, like I think about this a lot,  but I choose to think of the better option, the human 3.0 option. And even if it's a tiny chance  that we're actually going to get there, what else am I going to do? I'm not gonna sit around and  fret and worry and like be a doomer. I'm going to like lock onto that thing, describe it to others,  hopefully get people excited about it, and then

01:12:30
build the tools and the systems to hopefully help  get us there. So, if you're interested in this, if you want to build a similar thing, if you  just want to follow me like making this happen, uh check me out on uh YouTube. you're watching  this on a video, just hit all the YouTube buttons. I don't know how many there are. Probably seven  or eight. I don't know. Like, subscribe, all that stuff. Hit each of them like three or four times.  And uh newsletter and Twitter and X. Reply in

01:13:02
the comments. I will actually respond. And uh go  build some stuff. We'll see you in the next one.
