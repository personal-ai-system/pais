## Color Usage Guidelines

### Ratios

### Rules

1. **Dark dominates** - Background and line work make up majority
2. **Blue for structure** - Main components, boxes, important elements
3. **Cyan for flow** - Arrows, connections, data movement
4. **Purple sparingly** - Only for insights, callouts, emphasis
5. **White text always** - Never use dark text on dark background
